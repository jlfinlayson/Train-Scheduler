# Train Scheduler

The train scheduler application allows users to track trains by name, destination, frequency, next arrival, and by how many minutes away it is. Users are also able to input their own trains into the system if they are not already on the list. The schedule is built to utilize the current time for the most accurate schedules.<br>
